# PlataformaDnD

Welcome to *PlataformaDnD*, a personal project to practice my programming skills by creating a web hub themed around Dungeons & Dragons campaigns set in the One Piece universe.

## Description

This website will allow users to view, add, and remove content related to their roleplaying campaign, such as:

- Lore and world background
- Characters
- Settings and maps
- Other useful resources for the game

The goal is to centralize all the information to make management easier and enrich the gameplay experience.
